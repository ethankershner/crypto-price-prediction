    "## 0.1 Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This work builds on numerous academic papers that have found that tweet sentiment and volume are able to succesfully predict changes in cryptocurrency price (Stenqvist & Lonno, 2017, Coliani, Rosales & Signorotti, 2015). This work is unique in that it focuses on making predictions during shorter intervals than are typically examined by the majority of academic papers on this topic. Additionally, instead of only performing prediction modeling for Bitcoin, tweets related to Ethereum and Ethereum market data were collected alongside data pertaining to Bitcoin."

    "\n",
    "In this notebook previously collected data consisting of tweets related to Bitcoin and Ethereum as well as Bitcoin and Ethereum market data (including price and volume) are first cleaned and prepared for further use. Machine learning models are then instantiated and trained to make predictions about the direction of price changes using this data. Model accuracy is assessed using repeated k-fold cross validation. A variety of time intervals (time periods over which data is aggregated in order to predict cryptocurrency prices at the end of the next interval) are tested and results compared."

Using the [tweepy API](https://www.tweepy.org/) two real-time streams of tweets containing \"bitcoin\" (for the bitcoin stream) or \"ethereum\" (for the ethereum stream) were instantiated. Tweet data, consisting of a timestamp and tweet text were saved to respective CSV files. Tweet streams were closed and re-opened every 15 minutes to prevent potential errors from prematurely ending data collection.\n",
